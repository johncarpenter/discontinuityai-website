    title: 'Lane and Auto Identification for Self-Driving Cars',
    description: `As part of the Udacity Self-Driving Car program, I developed a lane and obstacle finding algorithm using only the front facing camera. Based on an machine learning model, the algorithm can identify vehicles and lane markings in a variety of situations. You can see the other videos from the course from the YouTube channel below.    `,

    title: '3D Map Clustering',
    description: `Using a quadtree algorithm, I helped generate a map clustering algorithm that took into consideration not only the relative location of the map points but the viewing angles of the observer. This allowed the company to implement the clustering from a birds eye view making the navigation mode much more intuitive`,

    title: 'Road Matching Algorithm',
    description: `Taking some of the work from my Geomatics engineering program, I helped a local company implement a map-matching algorithm that allowed noisy GPS data be filtered to existing road networks. `,
