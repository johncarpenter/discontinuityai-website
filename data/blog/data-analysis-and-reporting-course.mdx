Data Analysis and Reporting Course
==================================================================

The goal of this course is to understand data loading, transformations and reporting from a large scale data perspective. The course will be broken into two sessions; the first session will handle creating a data warehouse and connecting BI tools to it. The second session involves building custom tools to extract value from the warehouse.

By the end, the student should have a good grasp of how to collect, store and extract data from a variety of sources and display it in a manner that provides value to both customers and business.

The course will make use of open-source tools from JasperSoft, cloud providers AWS and Microsoft and integrate with commercial providers Tableau and PowerBI.
