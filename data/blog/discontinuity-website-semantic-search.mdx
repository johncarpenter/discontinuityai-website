## Overview
Getting information on a company from a website is typically based on a search and hunt. We know the company information will be in the nav bar at the top or linked in the footer. But, we don't know where. We have to search for it. This is a very inefficient way to get information.

Discontinuity Website Semantic Search is a demo that uses Discontinuity's Vector Database and Vector Embeddings to create a website search that is more intuitive and more accurate than traditional search engines.


## How It Works

### Indexing 

1. The Discontinuity Agent crawls through a series of knowledge base documents. In our case, it was a couple of marketing documents and use cases. 
2. The Agent splits the knowledge base by paragraphs and genereates a vector embedding for each paragraph.
3. That vector embedding is then stored in a Discontinuity Vector Database.

### Search

The vector database is essentially our database of knowledge ordered in a semantic way. So when we search a term like "marketing" we get a list of paragraphs that are most relevant to that term.

Those paragraphs are then fed into the OpenAI GPT-4 model as content to the question. The model then generates a response based on the context provided and the question asked.
